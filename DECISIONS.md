# Auto-Manager build decisions

Judgment calls made during the one-pass build, per the spec's "make the call,
document it, keep going."

## Platform
- **Python 3.10, not 3.11+.** The existing repo venv is 3.10.10 and every library
  used supports it; nothing 3.11-only is needed. Rebuilding the venv mid-season
  risks the draft-era toolchain for zero functional gain. `tzdata` added for
  Windows zoneinfo.
- **Runtime is GitHub Actions (rev 2)** — the rev-1 resident scheduler
  (APScheduler + Windows launcher + systemd unit) was built and then deleted
  when the modified spec landed; workflows in `.github/workflows/` are the
  only runtime now.
- **Same repo, new `manager/` package.** The spec says single repo; draftkit
  already owns Sleeper caching, the schedule parquet, league-scored weekly
  projections with placeholder fallback, lineup math, and ROS values (tiers.csv).
  Manager reuses those as a library and owns everything decision/delivery/scheduling.

## Delivery (rev 3 — GitHub Issues, user's call, 2026-08-27)
- **Primary backend is GitHub Issues, zero secrets**: github-actions[bot]
  opens an issue per event, @mentions the owner (mentions always notify:
  email + GitHub-app push), updates are comments on the same issue. The
  user pointed at this pattern from a prior repo; it beats SMTP here — no
  app password to mint/rotate, mobile push for [ACT NOW] alerts, and the
  issue list doubles as a decision log. Trade-off: GitHub prepends
  "[repo]" to notification subjects; the instruction still fits.
- Issues stay open (auto-closing would fire a second notification per
  event). Close them from the email/app if the list bothers you.

## Delivery (rev 2 — SMTP, superseded but kept as fallback)
- **Gmail SMTP** (`smtplib` stdlib, SSL 465) with app password; multipart
  plain+HTML via a tiny markdown converter — no email library dependency.
  Threading: the stored Message-ID is sent as In-Reply-To on updates, so an
  evolving event stays one thread. Content-hash idempotency is delivery-backend
  agnostic and survived the Discord->email swap unchanged.
- Missing SMTP secrets degrade to stdout with a banner (never crash); dry-run
  prints. Briefs also land in `reports/manager/` (untracked working copies).

## Module 0
- **Slate** = a distinct kickoff datetime (PT) among games involving my rostered
  teams or my current opponent's rostered teams. Inactives = kickoff − 90 min;
  the per-slate check fires at inactives + 10 min.
- **Plan pass rule**: for each day with a relevant slate, one lineup plan pass at
  (earliest inactives that day − 60 min), floored at 4:00 AM PT. A normal Sunday
  (10:00 AM PT slate) lands exactly at the spec's ~7:30 AM PT; a 6:30 AM PT
  international kickoff pulls it to 4:00 AM PT; the Wednesday opener gets its own
  Wednesday pass. This generalizes "earlier on international weeks" to every
  schedule quirk.
- **Missing gametime** in the schedule feed defaults to 1:00 PM ET with a logged
  warning (has not occurred in the 2026 REG schedule).

## Module 1
- **FAAB budgets**: authoritative number is the roster's `waiver_budget_used`
  field; transaction-history reconstruction (summed winning waiver bids) runs as
  a cross-check and powers the per-rival spend detail. A mismatch is reported in
  the brief rather than silently resolved (field wins).
- **Carries inside the 10 / route participation / YPRR** are not in free nflverse
  weekly data. The brief uses snap %, target share, targets, carries, receiving
  yards week-over-week and prints `DATA MISSING: inside-10 carries, routes (not
  in free nflverse weekly data)` per the degrade-gracefully rule.
- **Add ranking** blends: contingency class (inherits an injured starter's role),
  Sleeper trending count (24 h), usage deltas, ROS value from tiers.csv, and my
  positional need over the next 3 bye weeks. Weights in `manager/waiver_brief.py`.

## Module 3
- **Vegas thresholds** per spec: implied team total ≥ 24 → ×1.05, < 18 → ×0.95
  (single 5% notch; anything larger would double-count what projections already
  price in). No `ODDS_API_KEY` → `DATA MISSING: Vegas lines` and no adjustment.

## Module 4
- **Weekly positional stdev assumptions** (points, full PPR): QB 7.0, RB 6.0,
  WR 6.5, TE 5.0, K 4.5, DEF 6.0. Win probability = P(margin > 0) under a normal
  with variance = sum of both lineups' player variances. These are conventional
  fantasy-variance figures, not fitted; revisit once 2026 actuals accumulate.
- Ceiling/floor mode: |projected margin| ≥ 10 flips coin-flip decisions
  (underdog → ceiling, favorite → floor); otherwise projection decides.

## Module 5
- **Veto-risk flag**: offer/ask FantasyCalc value ratio below 0.7 (either
  direction) → "may draw veto votes." Crude by design; the spec forbids building
  a valuation model.
- **Seller window**: after week 5, a team below .500 AND ≥ 2 games out of the
  6th seed.
- **Desperation event**: a rival's optimal-lineup starter freshly Out/IR where I
  roster a same-position player worth 60–140 % of the downed starter (the
  "replacement-shaped asset"), flagged 48 h urgency.
- **Playoff-schedule arbitrage** is qualitative in v1: each target lists his
  team's weeks 15–17 opponents in the rationale. A numeric strength adjustment
  needs a defense-quality model this repo doesn't have yet; faking one would be
  worse than naming the opponents.

## Scheduling (rev 2 — GitHub Actions)
- **weekly.yml carries the PT-fixed events with BOTH possible UTC crons**
  (PDT/PST); `manager cron` guards on Pacific wall-clock inside the run and
  idempotent delivery absorbs the double fire. This avoids editing workflow
  files from within Actions (which would need a PAT with workflow scope — a
  fifth secret the spec doesn't list).
- **gate.yml runs `*/15 * * * *` but the first step is a stdlib-only guard**
  against `state/gate_hours.json` (committed by the planner: every UTC
  (weekday, hour) containing a check window + slack). Off-window ticks exit
  before Python/deps install, in seconds — this is the "derive the windows
  from the committed week plan" requirement without workflow-file rewriting.
- **A check that crashes is still marked done**: `_safe()` already emailed the
  failure with the traceback, and retrying a crashing check every 15 minutes
  for 45 minutes would spam five copies. At-least-once execution applies to
  the attempt; delivery of errors is the fallback path.
- **State is JSON files, not SQLite**: readable git diffs, painless
  `git pull --rebase`, and the Actions concurrency group (`manager-state`,
  no cancel) serializes writers. The old resident scheduler
  (APScheduler/MANAGER.bat/systemd) is deleted — the spec's runtime is Actions.
- Local Python stays 3.10 (venv); workflows pin 3.11. Both are tested by the
  same suite; nothing 3.11-only is used.

## Post-v2 item 1 — rival sampling pool (2026-08-31)
**The hypothesized bug did not reproduce, and the change shipped anyway as
modeling hygiene, not as a fix. Evidence:**

The spec expected `pool_size: 80` to starve the sim's rival pool in the late
rounds and thereby inflate survival. It does not, because the slice is the
top-80 of the REMAINING players, not of the original board. Measured over a
full 10-team Keefamania draft:

    pick  undrafted  old top-80 pool  rolling window  window ADP range
    97    138        80               119             94-151
    124   111        80               98              116-184
    144   91         80               78              124-187

The pool held exactly 80 candidates at every pick; undrafted never fell
below 91. Before/after mean survival at my own picks, rounds 10-14:
0.749/0.747, 0.720/0.717, 0.744/0.743, 0.708/0.708, 0.737/0.737 — deltas of
-0.002 to 0.000, i.e. nothing. The ADP Gaussian already assigns ~zero weight
to candidates far from the current pick, so pool composition beyond that
neighbourhood was never load-bearing.

Kept the rolling window regardless because (a) it makes the pool track the
pick instead of relying on a magic constant whose meaning was ambiguous —
the spec's other stated goal, (b) it is verified harmless, and (c) it is
strictly safer for smaller boards or deeper drafts where the fixed slice
COULD bind. `pool_size` still works as the floor (`pool_min`).
